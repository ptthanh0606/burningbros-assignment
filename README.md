## BurningBros interview assignment

This is my project for BurningBros interview assignment for frontend engineer role
Project is deployed using Vercel at: [burningbros-assignment.vercel.app]

## Project's technologies:

- [React + Typescript](https://react.dev/learn/typescript)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [Material-UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/)
- [React-query](https://tanstack.com/query/v3/)

---

## Features:

- Infinite scroll for products load
- Search product with `https://dummyjson.com/products/search` endpoint

> However, due to a little engaged in user experience, I fetched all of the categories but on hold for the fetch products by category feature since it is not in the requirement.
